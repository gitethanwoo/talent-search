# Tenex - What We're Selling

## One Sentence
Tenex helps businesses build their AI strategy, then we make it happen.

## What Tenex Is
AI-powered software development agency. But NOT a typical dev shop:
- We hire the best (one world-class engineer > 10 mediocre ones)
- We use AI (all off-the-shelf tools + build our own)
- We charge on outcomes (story points we define)
- We pay on outcomes (story points you complete, uncapped)

## Clients & Work
- Early-stage startups
- Established market leaders
- New media groups
- Building: agentic sidekicks, mobile apps, whatever clients need
- Diverse, complex problems - not one product forever

## Compensation
- $250,000 - $800,000+ annually (uncapped)
- Based entirely on story points delivered
- Your ceiling = your output, creativity, ambition
- Benefits: medical, dental, vision
- Unlimited vacation

## Requirements
- In-office NYC
- Elite engineering chops
- AI-first mindset (use tools + build automations)
- Relentless curiosity
- Team multiplier (elevate others)

## Core Values
1. **We give a shit** - excellence, sweat details, collect "Wows" from customers
2. **We take out the trash** - no ego, no task beneath us
3. **We never beat around the bush** - direct, clear communication
4. **We go down the rabbit hole** - curiosity, challenge "we've always done it this way"
5. **We do the right thing** - integrity, even when costly
6. **We operate like Navy SEALs** - nights and weekends when needed, mission-driven
7. **Share feedback, listen to feedback** - fast path to excellence

## The Real Hooks (Use in Outreach)

### For people frustrated by slow companies:
"Clients pay for outcomes. We pay for outcomes. No bureaucracy, no waiting for quarterly planning cycles."

### For people underpaid relative to output:
"If you're the person who ships 3x what others do but gets paid the same, that changes here. Story points = dollars."

### For people tired of carrying mediocre teammates:
"We only hire the best. You'll work alongside people who match your standards, not slow you down."

### For people bored of one product:
"Different clients, different problems. Startups one week, market leaders the next. Agentic AI, mobile apps, whatever needs building."

### For AI-native engineers:
"Everyone here uses AI tools. You're not the weird one for having Claude open all day. We build our own tools to get an edge."

### For high performers who want ownership:
"Your ceiling is your output. No politics, no tenure games. Build more, earn more."

## What NOT to Say
- Don't oversell work-life balance (Navy SEALs culture = intense)
- Don't say "dev shop" or "agency" without the differentiators
- Don't promise remote (it's in-office NYC)
- Don't undersell the intensity - we want people who want this

## Objection Handling

**"Sounds like a sweatshop"**
→ It's intense, but you own your output. No one micromanages - you're paid for what you ship, not hours worked.

**"Agency work is boring"**
→ Our clients are building AI products, not marketing sites. Agentic sidekicks, not landing pages.

**"I don't want to live in NYC"**
→ Fair - this role is in-office. If that changes, we'll reach out.

**"Uncapped sounds too good to be true"**
→ It's real. Story points are defined upfront with clients. You complete them, you get paid. Simple math.

**"I'm happy where I am"**
→ Understood. But if you ever feel like you're shipping more than you're earning, or want to work with people at your level, door's open.
